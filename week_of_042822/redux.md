# Using Redux

## About
When I was first introduced to the idea of `global state` in a MERN application, I was introduced 
to state via React's Context API.  I remember the steps to set up the global store being terribly 
confusing, and it wasn't until months later when I was going through the same material with other 
students that I finally worked out what was going on with the code.  (The Context API also left 
such a sour taste in my mouth that I didn't really want to look at it again until I absolutely 
had to.)

The reason for the above?  Well the reason is that once I got through the documentation for `Redux`, 
I found it much more straight-forward to use it to manage `global state`.  I definitely am not an 
expert on it, but it is my *go-to* when I want to manage state globally.

So, here are a few Redux related activities.

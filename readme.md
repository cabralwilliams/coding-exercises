    * [Brennan's JQuery and Bootstrap Demo](https://github.com/brennancodes) - Brennan does a masterful job melding jQuery and Bootstrap in this demonstration.
    * Shift The Flex - a much poorer Bootstrap demonstration than Brennan's version, but what more could you expect from Cabral?

* Week of 8-22-2022
    * In the `hero-draft` directory, there is an example of an application that uses redux, or more accurately `@redux/toolkit` (installed using `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`), to handle the appication's state.  I'm using localStorage to load information into state rather than a database, which you would normally do.  This is by no means finished, but you should be able to get some idea of how you can incorporate `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` into your application to manage global state.  Note how updates to state made in certain components/pages get carried over to seemingly unrelated components/pages.

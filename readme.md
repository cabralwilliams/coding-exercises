    * [Brennan's JQuery and Bootstrap Demo](https://github.com/brennancodes) - Brennan does a masterful job melding jQuery and Bootstrap in this demonstration.
    * Shift The Flex - a much poorer Bootstrap demonstration than Brennan's version, but what more could you expect from Cabral?

    * [Some Object Manipulation](https://github.com/cabralwilliams) - So far there are two exercises available, which already exceeds the over/under value of 1.  Can the list of object manipulation exercises extend to 3?  Almost certainly not.

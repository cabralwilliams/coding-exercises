# DOM - Document Object Model

## About
From the [Wikipedia site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), the DOM 
treats html documents as a tree structure where each node is an object and is part of the document.  
In these exercises, you will create the functionality that allows you dynamically change the DOM of 
an html document.

## Tasks
1. Create the functionality that will allow a button to when pushed add flexed divs to a document with alternating cases of `red font/blue background` and `blue font/red background` with the text being the word for the color of the background.
2. Create the functionality for two separate functions - the first will continuously add the lines of a given poem to the a specific element periodically, and the second will periodically replace the given line of the poem on the page with the next line in the poem.

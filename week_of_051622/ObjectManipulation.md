# Object Manipulation

As web developers interact with data from various API sources, they will have to learn how to deftly manipulate and reconfigure returned objects into more usable forms.  These exercises (or this exercise if I am particularly lazy with this) will test your ability to manipulate such objects.

## Tasks
1. Object Manipulation
    * Complete the function `alterObject` in the `assets/js/script.js` file and activate the button such that the desired objects appear on the html page when the button is clicked.

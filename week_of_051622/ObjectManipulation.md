# Object Manipulation

As web developers interact with data from various API sources, they will have to learn how to deftly manipulate and reconfigure returned objects into more usable forms.  These exercises (or this exercise if I am particularly lazy with this) will test your ability to manipulate such objects.

## Tasks
1. Object Manipulation
    * Complete the function `alterObject` in the `assets/js/script.js` file of the `IHateNull` directory and activate the button such that the desired objects appear on the html page when the button is clicked.
2. More Object Manipulation
    * If you hate `null`, then what do you like?  You like strings; that's what you like.  In the `assets/js/script.js` file of the `ILoveStrings` directory, complete the function `alterObject` that will get rid of all object properties except those that are strings.
3. Dare I say it - Even More Object Manipulation!
    * We've been creating all of these objects, but alas, they disappear as soon as we refresh or close the browser!  Let's hold on to the objects but only objects that have properties that are exclusively numbers.  Do what needs to be done in the `OnlyNumbersPlease` directory.

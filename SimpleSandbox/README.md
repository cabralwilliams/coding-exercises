# Simple Sandbox

I have often wondered how code sandboxes work, how one can create an environment where 
a user can enter text into a browser and then have that translated into working code.  
So, I decided to see whether I could mimic some of this behavior.  The functionality is 
limited at this point, but it does currently give users the ability to (1) declare and 
initialize variables in JavaScript and (2) test for loop creation with console logging of 
of the loop values.  (Yes, very limited at this point.)

The nice thing about this is that it also gave me a chance to work on `regular expressions`.  So, 
feel free to take a look.  (Creating the code to perform even these basic tasks gives me even 
more respect for the people who created these programming languages in the first place.)
